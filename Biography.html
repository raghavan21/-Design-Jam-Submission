<p id="para_1">Perhaps the name “Chris Gardner” doesn’t sound very familiar to you, but you’ve surely seen or heard about the movie The Pursuit of Happyness, starring Will Smith. The film is inspired by the true story of Christopher Gardner, a man who has faced many obstacles in life to achieve happiness, even being forced to sleep on the streets with his son.</p><br>
<p id="para_1">Christopher Paul Gardner was born on February 9, 1954, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His childhood was far from being a fairy tale; he had an absent father, and his mother, Bettye Jean, married a man named Freddie Triplett, someone who would deeply mark Chris’s life.</p><br>
<div id="p_con">
<p id="para_1">Triplett was abusive to his wife and children. He even reported Chris’s mother to the authorities and had her sent to prison for working while receiving help from Social Services. During that time, Chris and his 3 sisters had to temporarily live in foster homes. Months later, Bettye was released, but she would go back to jail again. Drowned in despair, she even tried to set Triplett’s house on fire with him inside.</p>
</div>
<div class="parallax"></div><br>
<p id="para_1">But out of all that suffering, one day would remain in Chris’s memory forever. It was Christmas and he was 16 years old. He was taking a bath when his stepfather suddenly broke into the bathroom with a shotgun and kicked him out of the house, leaving him on the street, wet and naked on a cold night.
After having lived through these sad experiences, Chris was clear about something: he would not become his stepfather. He chose to take his mother as an example of strength instead.
“I chose to embrace the spirit of my mom—who despite the fact that she had too many of her own dreams denied, deferred, and destroyed—still instilled in me that I could have dreams,” he confessed.</p>
<p id="para_1">Chris left Wisconsin when he entered the US Navy and joined the Medical Corps. There he met Dr. Robert Ellis, who offered him a job as a research assistant at the University of California Medical Center. It was 1974 when he moved to San Francisco.</p><br>
<p id="para_1">Once he saw a well-dressed man get out of a red Ferrari on the street. That day, his life changed. Impressed, Chris asked, “What do you do, and how do you do it?” The man was Bob Bridges, a stockbroker who made about $80,000 a month.</p><br>
<p id="para_1">With a young son and a deteriorating relationship, Chris was forced to look elsewhere for a new chance and got an interview at Dean Witter Reynolds to train as a stockbroker.</p><br>
<div class="parallax_2"></div><br>
<p id="para_1">But, once again, luck was not on his side, and, a little over a week before his job interview, he was arrested for $1,200 he had accumulated in fines. He spent 10 days in prison, and when he got out of jail, he realized Jackie had left, taking their son and all of his belongings. A day after his release, Chris had to attend his interview in the same clothes he had used during his time in prison: casual pants, sneakers, and a jacket. Despite that, he was accepted into the internship program. He would receive a salary of $1,000 a month.</p><br>
<p id="para_1">After going through considerably tough times and standing out as a dedicated and persevering intern, Chris took the exam to obtain his license as a stockbroker in 1982. He passed and managed to get a stable job with a much better salary. Now he was able to pay rent.</p><br>
<p id="para_1">Chris had gone from being an apprentice with nowhere to sleep to being a respected stockbroker. He was even offered a chance to work on Wall Street in New York and lived in that city for 2 years before moving to Chicago and starting Gardner Rich & Co., his own company with an initial investment of $10,000 in 1987.</p><br>
<p id="para_1">A year later, he managed to earn over a million dollars. Lack of money was no longer a problem for him. Excited about his achievements, he bought his own Ferrari, but not just anyone, he bought one that had formerly belonged to basketball player Michael Jordan.</p><br>
<p id="para_1">By 2006, Chris had managed to grow his company immensely and sold it in a multi-million dollar deal. He later became the founder of Christopher Gardner International Holdings and placed offices in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. Through it, he contributes to various philanthropic organizations related to education, access to housing, and job creation projects.</p><br>
<p id="para_1">Chris is currently a successful lecturer who travels the world motivating people to pursue their dreams and explaining topics related to business success. This is very fulfilling for him.</p>
